# Sharpie

Basic CLI for resizing images (perhaps more features in the future?).

```
Usage: sharpie <input> <width> [aspect|height] <output>
```

- input: File path to the input image.
- width: Target width in px.
- aspect: aspect ratio in space delimited array (e.g.: `16 9`).
- height: Target height in px.
- output: File path of the output image.

## Installation

Node.js is required to run Sharpie.

Clone this repository somewhere.
